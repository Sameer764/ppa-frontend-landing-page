I wasn’t very good with DSA initially but as the time went by, I kept practising and with doubt resolution sessions, resume building sessions, Live classes etc that takes place here, I could feel the difference in my skills and till date I keep on practising DSA as and when time allows to never leave the touch of that. I even had my offer letter from Amazon to join them as SDE, however I wanted to join Sharechat and went for it."]

        studentReview:["Well, In the beginning of third year, I wanted to learn data structures and algorithms so, I started searching for it online from multiple different websites and gained a bit of knowledge about DSA. By the end of my third year I came across Programming Pathshala which is absolutely a great platform to learn algorithms and data structures from. I was a part of an Internship with a company and during that internship I even opted for a Programming Pathshala’s course (Renaissance). I have opted for the “Renaissance” course twice and both times, for three months.Firstly for three months I couldn’t complete the course so I opted for three more months again. It’s bit of a lengthy course but definitely worth it. After completing the course I got referred to BharatPe, and finally I got this opportunity to work as an intern here."]

I later joined another training program by Programming Patshala itself in the year 2019–20 for 2 weeks and after it ended, I again stopped practicing.",
            "Soon I got placed at Rakuten and remember calling Anoop veerji, that I got placed at Rakuten but in the Testing Domain, He asked me to keep preparing and join the course Renaissance.I joined Rakuten and Renaissance simultaneously and it’s been a year since I have been associated with Programming Pathshala as well as Rakuten now.",
            "I did give up many times before, but this time when I joined the course, I made sure that I was consistent with it and practiced problem solving everyday. As you can see, The results speak louder today!"]
